CloudFlare Dynamic DNS

Docker container with basic script to use CloudFlare DNS as a Dynamic DNS provider. This is especially useful for homelabs where you want to expose some services to the public, but don't always have a fixed IP address. 

Note: This does not work if your ISP uses Carrier Grade Network Address Translation (Carrier-Grade NAT/CGNAT).
